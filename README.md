# Hand Gesture Recognition Model Development

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a **Hand Gesture Recognition Model** that can accurately classify different hand gestures from image or video data. This model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. Key components include preprocessing image data, implementing and fine-tuning a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, and evaluating its accuracy on different gestures.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Importing Libraries and Datasets
Import all necessary libraries and load the hand gesture dataset. The dataset should contain images with various labeled hand gestures.

### 2. Data Understanding
Analyze the dataset structure, checking image dimensions, class distributions, and any null or corrupt data. Perform an initial visualization of sample images to understand the gesture types.

### 3. Data Preprocessing and Augmentation
Convert images to grayscale if needed, resize to standard dimensions, and normalize pixel values. Perform data augmentation to increase dataset size and diversity, which helps in reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.

### 4. Model Development and Training
Build a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with multiple layers to learn from image data:
- Define convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Add pooling layers for dimensionality reduction.
- Implement dense layers for classification.
- Train the model with training data and validate it using the test dataset.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Prediction
Evaluate the model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualize results using confusion matrix and ROC curves to assess classification accuracy across gesture classes.
